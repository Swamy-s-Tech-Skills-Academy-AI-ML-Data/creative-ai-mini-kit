Here's an example of a simple implementation of a singly linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def delete(self, data):
        current = self.head
        prev = None
        found = False
        while current and not found:
            if current.data == data:
                found = True
            else:
                prev = current
                current = current.next
        if found:
            if prev is None:
                self.head = current.next
            else:
                prev.next = current.next
        else:
            print("Data not found")

    def display(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Example usage
ll = LinkedList()
ll.insert(1)
ll.insert(2)
ll.insert(3)
ll.display()

ll.delete(2)
ll.display()
```

In this example, we have a `Node` class to represent each element in the linked list, and a `LinkedList` class with `insert`, `delete`, and `display` methods for manipulating and displaying the linked list. You can use this as a starting point and customize it further to suit your specific needs.
