Purchased this smart watch last month and I'm thoroughly impressed. The fitness tracking is accurate, and the sleep monitoring has been eye-opening. The band is comfortable for all-day wear, though the charging cable is a bit finicky. Overall, it's become an essential part of my daily routine and the battery easily lasts 3-4 days on a single charge.
